## What you'll build

![Architecture diagram of the supergraph](04-diagram.png)

## Part A: Setup Open Telemetry

Run the "Deploy Open Telemetry Collector" Github workflow to provisions the necessary resources your `prod` cluster:

```sh
gh workflow run "Deploy Open Telemetry Collector" --repo $GITHUB_ORG/apollo-supergraph-k8s-infra
```

The router and subgraphs are already configured to send Open Telemetry traces to the collector, which is configured to send traces to Google Trace.

## Part B: Demonstrate traces and metrics

Make a GraphQL request to the router via its IP address:

```sh
kubectx apollo-supergraph-k8s-prod
ROUTER_IP=$(kubectl get ingress -n router -o jsonpath="{.*.*.status.loadBalancer.ingress.*.ip}")
open http://$ROUTER_IP
```

Visit [Google Trace](https://console.cloud.google.com/traces/list) to view traces.

## Onward!
